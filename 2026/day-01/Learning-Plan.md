# DevOps 90 Days Course with TWS

# 🚀 My 90-Day DevOps Study Plan

## Overview

This 90-day DevOps and Cloud learning plan is designed to build a strong foundation and transition from beginner to job-ready DevOps/Cloud Engineer. The focus is on understanding DevOps as a culture of collaboration between development and operations, supported by automation, reliability, and scalability.

Alongside DevOps principles, cloud engineering skills will be developed to deploy, manage, and scale applications efficiently using cloud platforms. The plan emphasizes learning core technologies such as Linux, networking, Git, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud services through hands-on practice and real-world projects.

## Learning Philosophy

Consistency and discipline are central to this study plan. A dedicated commitment of **four hours of daily study**, combined with:

- Practical hands-on labs  
- Daily revision  
- Peer collaboration  

ensures continuous progress and skill reinforcement.

By maintaining this structured routine and focusing on applied learning rather than theory alone, the goal is to become job-ready within 90 days and confidently begin a professional career as a DevOps Engineer.

## Goals

- Build a strong DevOps and Cloud foundation  
- Develop hands-on experience with industry tools  
- Create real-world projects and labs  
- Become job-ready within 90 days  
- Transition into a DevOps/Cloud Engineer role
